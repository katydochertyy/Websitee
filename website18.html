        <h1 style="color:blue;">Food Basics</h1>
      <p>Food is important as it helps humans & animals survive.  The body needs a variety of the following 5 nutrients - 
        protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins and minerals - from the food we eat to stay healthy and productive.
        Protein - is needed to build, maintain and repair muscle, blood, skin and bones and other tissues
        and organs in the body.  Protein - is needed to build, maintain and repair muscle, blood, skin and bones and
        other tissues and organs in the body.
        Foods rich in protein include meat, eggs, dairy and fish.
        Carbohydrate - provides the body with its main source of energy.
        Carbohydrates can be classified into two kinds; starches and sugars. Food rich in
        starches include rice, maize, wheat and potatoes and food rich in sugars include fruit,
        honey, sweets and chocolate bars.  Fat - This is the body's secondary source of energy. 
        Fat actually provides more energy/calories per gram than any other nutrient, but is more 
        difficult to burn.  Food rich in fats are oils, butter, lard, milk, cheese and some meat.
        Vitamins and Minerals - Vitamins and minerals are needed in very small amounts and are 
        sometimes called micronutrients, but are essential for good health. They
        control many functions and processes in the body, and in the case of minerals also
        help build body tissue such as bones (calcium) and blood (iron). To learn more about
        specific vitamins and minerals see the Vitamins and Minerals information sheet
        below.  In addition to the above nutrients Fibre and Water are also essential for a good
        healthy diet.</p>

                <h3 style="color:blue;">Exercise</h3>
                
                <p> Exercise Daily
                        
                Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort 
                of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. 
                For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour.
                Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. 
                It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods 
                with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.
                
                Be Sure to Get Sleep
                        
                Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough sleep to recharge the
                body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but if you happen to feel tired
                at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising. You should only nap for about 
                a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.

                <p> What are nutrients and why are they good for you?
                                
                Nutrients are the substances in food that our bodies process to enable it to function. Your nutrient requirements are influenced 
                by factors including your age, growth stage and activity. Nutrients are so small that the naked eye can’t see them.
                Nutrients can generally be broken into two categories: macronutrients – carbohydrates, protein, fats; and micronutrients
                – vitamins and minerals such as calcium, iron, vitamin C.  Macronutrients make up a majority of our diets and provide 
                energy for us to move and function. Micronutrients, on the other hand, are chemical substances that we require in small 
                amounts for healthy growth and development.  Nowadays there are many nutrient-poor foods available – this means
                they don’t contain much nutrition that your body needs to function. Instead, the food is full of excess energy 
                (kilojoules), but it’s not nutritional. This excess energy means that the food will provide your body with kilojoules,
                but it’s void of other essential nutrients that your body needs to function.

                <p>
                
                        Include fruits and vegetables in your diet
                
                <ol>
                <li>Adding fruits and vegetables is a perfect foundation for starting a healthy routine. Vegetables, like leafy greens,
                and fruits contain plentiful amounts of nutrients such as vitamins and antioxidants that help boost your immune system 
                and fight off disease causing toxins. Antioxidants help fight eye disease, promote healthy skin, and overall health. 
                The World Health Organization recommends eating fruits and veggies as a regular part of your diet so you’ll have a 
                better chance of fighting some cancers, diseases, and heart disease. Make sure to eat five to nine servings of 
                varied veggie and fruits per day.
                </li>
                
                <p>Drink Water</p>
                
                <li>You can save money and improve your health by drinking water throughout the day. The natural liquid offers the benefits
                of hydration, nourishment, and improved well-being. Water can cleanse toxins from the body, improve brain function, 
                energize muscles, control weight gain, and balance body temperature and fluids. It’s recommended to drink about 8 
                glasses, or 64 ounces, of water per day.</li>

                <p>When it comes to building a healthy lifestyle, it’s easy to concentrate on the physical aspects of health and ignore
                the mental upkeep. Remember that your mental health is a foundation of your overall health. It’s important to manage
                and asses your feelings on a day-to-day basis. If you feel negative towards others, you could cause more unhappiness
                at work, school, or in your social life. Some ways you can improve your mental health include:
             
                Exercising<br/>
                Socializing with loved ones<br/>
                Joining a club<br/>
                Sleeping between 7-9 hours every night<br/>
                Do something creative<br/>
                If you continue to feel unhappy or even depressed, consult your physician or talk to a professional about ways<br/>
                You can improve your mental health. </p>

             Sometimes it’s beneficial to stop, take a deep breath, and relax. You can help maintain your physical and mental
                        health by decompressing from a long, stressful school or work week. Try some relaxing activities to help 
                        you relax. Take advantage of meditation, listening to music, reading, watching a comedy, or exercising.
                        These activities can help you unwind and they cause feelings of happiness and clam.

                The body is truly the temple of the soul, and you don’t want that temple to fall apart! Exercise 
                is a great way to stimulate your health and studies have shown that physical activity helps
                improve longevity and overall health. Try to exercise up to three times a week. The American
                Heart Association advises for 150 minutes of exercise each week or an hour at least three 
                times a week. Pick a convenient time schedule out time. You could exercise for 30 minutes 
                the morning to get energized for your day.
                                
                Remember to keep your workouts fun. You should enjoy your workout and not feel like it’s a chore. Some fun physical activities include:
                                
                Dancing,
                Yoga,

                        <h3 style="color:rgba(247, 14, 208, 0.829);">Why is good Health Important?</h3> 
                        
        <p>You appreciate the real value of your health only after it’s lost. In its absence, when you fight the never-ending health problems, you understand 
        how tough life can be without it.  Realizing this, every time you get sick you act out of fear so that things don’t get worse. Yet, 
        as soon as you get well, most often, you stop maintaining your health.  This brings up the question: Why don’t you realize the
        importance of health maintenance, in living a good life, before your health is worsening?  If you don’t understand this
        simple concept, your body won’t protect your health at its full potential. As a result, your body will be prone to develop all kinds 
        of pains in the joints, back, legs, etc, which will make your life even harder.  Unfortunately, suffering from body aches is not an enjoyable living.
        The good news is that there is an alternative.  You could eat healthier, exercise, and remove the bad habits out of your 
        lifestyle, which would maintain your health strong. This kind of lifestyle will prevent your health from the sicknesses of tomorrow.

        <p>Healthy living is a lifestyle, not a short-term goal
        Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is not easy when you have a day job, a family, or both.  It adds up so many tasks on your part that
        you hardly find time for yourself. By the end of the day, when the working day is over and kids are sleeping, you can finally 
        have some rest and watch TV.  In your gut, you feel that you need to live healthier, but you don’t know how.  Despite the lack of time,
        you decide to go on a two-week diet and, after that, you plan to attend the gym for another 3 months. This should bring your body 
        in good shape by summer, but it is not enough to keep you healthy for a lifetime.  Unfortunately, the two-week diet and the
        three-month exercising program are not enough to say that you follow a healthy lifestyle.  To follow a healthy lifestyle, the first 
        thing you need to do is to give up on bad habits. From there, you’ll gain more willpower to exercise and eat healthier.</p>
        
        <p>Healthy living prevents disorder in life
        Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
        
        Life is an ongoing process that impacts important aspects of it. If you don’t control these changes, life gradually declines into disorder.
        
        As James Clear explains:
        "It is the natural tendency of things to lose order. Left to its own devices, life will always become less
        structured. Sand castles get washed away. Weeds overtake gardens. Ancient ruins crumble. Cars begin to rust. People gradually age. 
        With enough time, even mountains erode and their precise edges become rounded. The inevitable trend is that things become
        less organized. Entropy: Why Life Always Seems to Get More Complicated – James Clear." </p>
<br/>
        
        Let’s take the human body, as an example.
        
        As it ages, the hair grays out, the skin loses its elasticity, wrinkles appear on the face, health slows down, etc. 
        These changes become noticeable as you grow and are a sign that your health requires your attention.  Healthy living slows 
        down the decline of your health into disorder. It provides a living with fewer health-related sufferings. It improves 
        self-confidence and self-esteem. And it feels good when you can enjoy life. </p>

        alt="Good Health Effects" style="width:312px;height:210.3px;">  

        <p>The ability to control your health by tweaking your lifestyle is the distinctive aspect of health. You don’t have such control in other aspects of your life.
        
                <br/>    For example.</p>
        
        <p>Relationships: you can’t have somebody involve in a relationship with you if that person doesn’t feel anything for you. You can’t have
         control over someone’s feelings.</p>
     
        Money making: To improve your financial status you need to have skills that you can sell. It takes years to gain skills but in the end, 
        the customer decides whom to hire.
        
        In sport: if you want to become a champion in karate you must beat your opponent. Unfortunately, if you don’t have control over
         your opponent’s training process to be able to influence it somehow.
